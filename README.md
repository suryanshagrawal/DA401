# 📊 DA 401 Final Project – Bank Capital Buffer Analysis

**Author**: Suryansh Agrawal  
**Course**: DA 401 – Bank Equity  
**Institution**: Denison University  
**Semester**: Spring 2025

## 🧠 Project Overview

This project explores the question:  
**"Why do U.S. banks hold excess capital (equity) beyond regulatory requirements after the 2008 Financial Crisis and the implementation of Basel III CET1 requirements in 2017?"**

Using a combination of empirical regression analysis and theoretical frameworks such as Minsky’s Financial Instability Hypothesis and Basel III regulatory reforms, this project investigates the determinants of excess capital holding across U.S. banks.
